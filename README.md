## Why This Bot? 

**The Problem:** Slack AI costs $10/user/month ($1,000/month for 100 users!) and your data goes to their servers.

**This Solution:** 
-  **Your data stays yours** (stored locally)
-  **$5/month total cost** (vs $1,000/month for Slack AI)
-  **Owner-only access** (only you can use it)
-  **Complete privacy control**

## What It Does 

- **Smart Search**: "Find all messages about the budget"
- **Team Analytics**: "Who's been most active this week?"
- **Summaries**: "What happened while I was out?"
- **Context Answers**: "What did we decide about the new feature?"

## Cost Comparison 

| Solution | 100 Users | Your Data | 
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Slack AI** | $12,000/year |  Goes to Slack |
| **This Bot** | $60/year |  Stays with you |
| **Savings** | **$11,940/year** |  **Full control** |
