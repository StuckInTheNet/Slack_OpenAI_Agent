## Why This Bot? 🎯

**The Problem:** Slack AI costs $10/user/month ($1,000/month for 100 users!) and your data goes to their servers.

**This Solution:** 
- ✅ **Your data stays yours** (stored locally)
- ✅ **$5/month total cost** (vs $1,000/month for Slack AI)
- ✅ **Unlimited users**
- ✅ **Complete privacy control**

## What It Does 💡

- **Smart Search**: "Find all messages about the budget"
- **Team Analytics**: "Who's been most active this week?"
- **Summaries**: "What happened while I was out?"
- **Context Answers**: "What did we decide about the new feature?"

## Cost Comparison 💰
