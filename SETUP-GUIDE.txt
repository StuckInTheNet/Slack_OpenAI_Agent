🚀 SLACK AI BOT - SETUP GUIDE
=============================

Welcome! Let's get your AI assistant running in 15 minutes.

📋 WHAT YOU NEED:
- A Slack workspace (free or paid)
- An OpenAI account (free to create)
- Node.js installed (we'll help you get this)

🎯 STEP 1: INSTALL NODE.JS (5 minutes)
=====================================

Node.js is what runs the bot. It's free and safe.

→ Go to: https://nodejs.org
→ Download the version for your computer
→ Install it (just click through the installer)

Test if it worked:
• Windows: Press Windows key + R, type "powershell", press Enter
• Mac: Press Cmd + Space, type "terminal", press Enter

Then type: node --version
You should see something like: v18.17.0

🎯 STEP 2: RUN THE SETUP WIZARD (5 minutes)
===========================================

Now we'll run an interactive setup that does everything for you.

In the same Terminal/PowerShell window from above:

1. Type: cd 
2. Drag this folder (the one with all the bot files) into the window
3. Press Enter
4. Type: npm install
5. Wait for it to finish
6. Type: node setup-wizard.js

The wizard will now ask you questions and help you get:
✅ Your Slack bot token
✅ Your OpenAI API key  
✅ Everything configured properly

Just follow the prompts - it will tell you exactly what to do!

🎯 STEP 3: GET YOUR SLACK TOKENS (from the wizard)
===================================================

The wizard will guide you through this, but here's what it does:

1. Takes you to: https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Helps you create a new Slack app
3. Walks you through adding Bot Token Scopes (see SLACK-SCOPES.md for details)
4. Gets your bot token and signing secret

❓ Can't find a scope like "users:read"? Skip it - the bot works without it!

🎯 STEP 4: GET YOUR OPENAI KEY (from the wizard)
=================================================

1. Takes you to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Helps you create an account if needed
3. Shows you how to create an API key
4. Usually costs $1-5/month for normal use

🎯 STEP 5: START YOUR BOT! (automatic)
======================================

The wizard will:
✅ Test all your keys work
✅ Start the bot automatically
✅ Show you how to invite it to channels
✅ Give you example questions to ask

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

"I can't find Terminal/PowerShell"
→ Windows: Right-click in this folder while holding Shift → "Open PowerShell"
→ Mac: Applications → Terminal, then drag this folder in

"node --version gives an error" 
→ Node.js didn't install properly. Try downloading again from nodejs.org

"npm install gives errors"
→ Make sure you're in the right folder (you should see package.json)
→ Try: npm cache clean --force, then npm install again

"The wizard won't start"
→ Make sure you typed: node setup-wizard.js (not just setup-wizard.js)
→ Make sure you're in the bot folder

"I'm completely stuck"
→ Read SETUP-HELP.md for more detailed troubleshooting
→ Ask for help: https://github.com/StuckInTheNet/Slack_OpenAI_Agent/issues

🎉 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
=====================

Once your bot is running:

1. Invite it to a Slack channel: /invite @YourBotName
2. Ask it questions like:
   • @YourBot who talked the most today?
   • @YourBot summarize the last 2 hours
   • @YourBot find messages about the project

3. Try slash commands:
   • /ai-summary - get a quick summary
   • /ai-search pizza - find all messages about pizza
   • /ai-help - see what else it can do

Your AI assistant is now ready to help your team! 🤖
